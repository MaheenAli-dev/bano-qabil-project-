        <p>The Culture of Sindh (Sindhi: سنڌ جي ثقافت) has its roots in the Indus Valley civilization. Sindh has been
            shaped by the largely desert region, the natural resources it had available, and continuous foreign
            influence. The Indus or Sindhu River that passes through the land, and the Arabian Sea (that defines its
            borders) also supported the seafaring traditions among the local people.[1] The local climate also reflects
            why the Sindhis have the language, folklore, traditions, customs and lifestyle that are so different from
            the neighboring regions.[2][3] The Sindhi culture is also practiced by the Sindhi diaspora.</p>
        <p>The roots of Sindhi culture go back to the distant past. Archaeological research during 19th and 20th
            centuries showed the roots of social life, religion and culture of the people of the Sindh: their
            agricultural practices, traditional arts and crafts, customs and tradition and other parts of social life,
            going back to a mature Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BC. Recent researches have traced
            the Indus valley civilization to even earlier ancestry.</p>

            <h1><i> Punjabi Culture</i></h1>
        </div>
        <p>Punjabi culture grew out of the settlements along the five rivers (the name Punjab, is derived from two
            Persian words, Panj meaning "Five" and Âb meaning "Water") which served as an important route to the Near
            East as early as the ancient Indus Valley civilization, dating back to 3000 BCE.[1] Agriculture has been the
            major economic feature of the Punjab and has therefore formed the foundation of Punjabi culture, with one's
            social status being determined by landownership.[1] The Punjab emerged as an important agricultural region,
            especially following the Green Revolution during the mid-1960's to the mid-1970's, has been described as the
            "breadbasket of both India and Pakistan".[1] Besides being known for agriculture and trade, the Punjab is
            also a region that over the centuries has experienced many foreign invasions and consequently has a
            long-standing history of warfare, as the Punjab is situated on the principal route of invasions through the
            northwestern frontier of the Indian subcontinent, which promoted to adopt a lifestyle that entailed engaging
            in warfare to protect the land.[1] Warrior culture typically elevates the value of the community's honour
            (izzat), which is highly esteemed by Punjabis.[1]</p>

        <p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (/ˌkaɪbər pəkˈtuːŋkwə/; Pashto: خېبر پښتونخوا; Urdu, Hindko: خیبر پختونخوا), commonly
            abbreviated as KP or KPK, is a province of Pakistan. Located in the northwestern region of the country,
            Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the smallest province of Pakistan by land area and the third-largest province by
            population. It is bordered by the Pakistani provinces of Balochistan to the south, Punjab to the south-east,
            the territory of Gilgit-Baltistan to the north and north-east, Islamabad Capital Territory to the east and
            Azad Kashmir to the north-east. It shares an international border with Afghanistan to the west. Khyber
            Pakhtunkhwa has a varied landscape ranging from rugged mountain ranges, valleys, plains surrounded by hills,
            undulating submontane areas and dense agricultural farms.

            While it is the third-largest Pakistani province in terms of both its population and its economy, it is
            geographically the smallest.[3] The province is home to 17.9 percent of Pakistan's total population, with
            the majority of its inhabitants being Pashtuns.

            Once a stronghold of Buddhism, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the site of the ancient region of Gandhara, including
            the ruins of the Gandharan capital of Pushkalavati (located near modern-day Charsadda). The region's history
            is characterized by frequent invasions by various empires, largely due to its geographical proximity to the
            historically important Khyber Pass.[4]

        <p>The culture of Balochistan (Urdu: بلوچ ثقافت), (Balochi: بلۏچی دۏد) or simply Baloch culture is defined in

            Balochi cinema plays a significant role in Baloch culture.[3][4][5] Quetta, the provincial capital of
            Balochistan, has several beautiful historical monuments such as Pirak, Chaukhandi tombs and Quaid-e-Azam
            Residency.[6]

            Balochistan celebrates its culture day every year where people from different villages gather together to
            organise several types of cultural programs. It marks its historical significances across the provincial
            state.[7] It includes folk music, dance, craft exhibition and other activities.[8]

            involves in circus performances, rifle shooting and other cultural programs and shows. It was named after an
            emperor who ruled this region. The festival is celebrated to honour the diversified culture of Balochistan
            state
